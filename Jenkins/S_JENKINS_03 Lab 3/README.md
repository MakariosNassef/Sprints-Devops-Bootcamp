S_JENKINS_03 Lab 3

## 1. what are different method to trigger pipeline in jenkins ? 
    1- Git Push: A pipeline can be triggered whenever changes are pushed to a Git repository. This is a common way to automatically build and test code as soon as it is committed.

    2- Timer: A pipeline can be set to run automatically at regular intervals, such as every hour or every day. This can be useful for running routine tasks, such as backups or database updates.

    3- Manual Trigger: A pipeline can be triggered manually through the Jenkins interface. This is useful when a pipeline needs to be run on demand, such as when a bug is reported or a new feature is ready for testing.

    4- Webhook: A pipeline can be triggered by a webhook, which is a way for one system to communicate with another. For example, a pipeline can be triggered whenever a new issue is created in a GitHub repository.

    5- API Call: A pipeline can be triggered through the Jenkins API, which allows you to automate pipeline triggers from other scripts or applications.
